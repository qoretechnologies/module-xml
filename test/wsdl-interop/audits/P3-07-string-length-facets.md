# P3-07 audit: string and length restrictions

Copyright (C) 2026 Qore Technologies, s.r.o.

All 62 checks are Pass or N/A; final verification completed with no new failures.

Scope: WSDL.qm, string/list-length regressions and consumer worker, independent
string/length matrix and oracle configuration, strict string value assertions and
selection, current reports, scalar design, README and execution evidence.
No C++ change is part of this commit. Core DataProvider dependency cbb8aceb2 was
separately tested and audited before its commit; unrelated core work is excluded.

The complete audit-changes skill was reread. Applicable guidance was reviewed in
qore-module-structure.md, module-sandboxing-audit-guide.md,
cooperative-cancellation.md, data-provider-checklist.md and
data-provider-development-guide.md (the referenced development-guide.md's actual
repository filename). All 62 checklist items are recorded below.

Audit corrections: repeated restricted/native list values and singleton/empty
item counts; invalid string field choices; enumeration and length example bypasses;
absolute pattern anchors for final newlines; provider metadata/category validation;
reconstruction of constant-time string enumeration membership. Normative oracle
disagreements and Xerces code-point configuration are documented in
[sized-facets-adjudication.md](../sized-facets-adjudication.md).

Final verification: 41 Qore suites / 521 cases pass without warnings; the focused
suite passes 12 cases / 313 assertions. Full Python discovery runs 106 tests with
exactly seven unchanged, tracked P4/P5/P6 failures, no errors/skips/warnings. The
new matrices independently check 1400 input/output documents across 163 schemas
and 326 real SOAP contracts. Qdx/Doxygen passes without warnings. The expanded
strict gate passes 88 descriptions / 752 directions, and all 220 broad failure
rows remain unchanged. No original fixture or historical finding was modified.
Both current reports identify WSDL SHA-256
47f82ce4865fb0861003b95c88b9144696ddb25e26023d89ed3c231eb374e456.
Logs use /tmp/wsdl-p3-07-completed-*; EXECUTION.md records the environment and
remaining phase requirements. There is no new native code requiring Valgrind.

| Check | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Entry exists in `doxygen/lang/120_modules.dox.tmpl` (for modules in the Qore repo; N/A for external module repos) | N/A | Existing single-file external WSDL module; no new module or layout change. |
| 2. Entry exists in `doxygen/lang/900_release_notes.dox.tmpl` (for modules in the Qore repo; external modules have release notes in their .qm) | Pass | WSDL 0.5.8 release notes describe string/length restrictions, provider reconstruction, occurrence lists and bounded examples. |
| 3. `qore_user_module()` or `qore_external_user_module()` call in `CMakeLists.txt` | Pass | Existing qore_external_user_module registration builds and documents WSDL; Qdx/Doxygen validation uses the local module. |
| 4. Module added to QMOD list in `CMakeLists.txt` | N/A | Existing single-file external WSDL module; no new module or layout change. |
| 5. `.qm` file has `@section <lowercasemodname>intro` as first doc section — **must be all lowercase** (e.g., `avrodataproviderintro`, not `AvroDataProviderintro`) | Pass | wsdlintro remains the first documentation section. |
| 6. `%modern` in `.qm` file — no redundant `%new-style`, `%require-types`, `%strict-args`, `%enable-all-warnings` | Pass | WSDL uses %modern; no redundant parse directives were introduced. |
| 7. No parse directives (`%requires`, `%modern`, `%new-style`) in separated `.qc` files (check OUTSIDE of `@code` blocks only) | N/A | Existing single-file external WSDL module; no new module or layout change. |
| 8. No `%include` usage (deprecated for modules) | Pass | No %include was introduced. |
| 9. Copyright 2026 on all new files | Pass | Authored test, worker and adjudication files have 2026 notices; existing module/design notices include 2026. |
| 10. Directory layout: `.qm` inside `qlib/<ModuleName>/` directory (not at `qlib/<ModuleName>.qm` for multi-file modules) | N/A | Existing single-file external WSDL module; no new module or layout change. |
| 11. No second `.qm` for the same module at `qlib/<ModuleName>.qm` | N/A | Existing single-file external WSDL module; no new module or layout change. |
| 12. `ns=Qore::XX` matches the QoreNamespace constructor path | N/A | No C++, QPP, native I/O or native loop changes. |
| 13. `%modern` directive present | Pass | The new Qore suite and consumer worker explicitly use %modern. |
| 14. Executable permission set (`chmod +x`) | Pass | The Qore suite and consumer worker are executable (0755). |
| 15. Uses %prepend-module-path  before %requires for in-repo modules (Qore and Qore modules only; not Qorus) | Pass | Both Qore files prepend local qlib before the relative WSDL requirement; xml is delivered by this repository. |
| 16. External module dependencies use `%try-module` — except modules delivered with the project itself (Qore ex: DataProvider, ConnectionProvider, QUnit, etc.) which use hard `%requires` | Pass | The worker guards external json; QUnit is supplied by Qore and xml by this project. |
| 17. No filesystem operations (fopen, open, creat, unlink, remove, rename, mkdir, rmdir, stat, chmod) without sandbox checks | N/A | No C++, QPP, native I/O or native loop changes. |
| 18. No network operations (connect, bind, socket, getaddrinfo, gethostbyname) without sandbox checks | N/A | No C++, QPP, native I/O or native loop changes. |
| 19. If filesystem/network ops exist, verify `QoreSandboxManagerHelper` usage | N/A | No C++, QPP, native I/O or native loop changes. |
| 20. No `File::`, `Dir::`, `Socket::`, `HTTPClient::` usage without justification | Pass | Production changes perform in-memory validation only. The test worker reads authored manifests/WSDL with ReadOnlyFile; temporary files and bounded subprocesses belong to the harness. |
| 21. All `for`/`while` loops that could iterate >100 times have `qore_check_cancel()` checks | N/A | No C++, QPP, native I/O or native loop changes. |
| 22. Uses `qore_check_cancel()` (NOT deprecated `qore_check_io_interrupt()`) | N/A | No C++, QPP, native I/O or native loop changes. |
| 23. Check frequency: every 100 iterations for tight loops, every 10 for expensive iterations | N/A | No C++, QPP, native I/O or native loop changes. |
| 24. No blocking operations without cancellation support | N/A | No C++, QPP, native I/O or native loop changes. |
| 25. Every action has `display_name`, `short_desc` (plain text, <80 chars), `desc` (markdown) | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 26. Every action has `options` populated via `getActionOptionFromFields()` — without this, the action shows an empty, unusable form | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 27. Every action has `output_type` set to a typed data type constant (e.g., `MyResponseDataType`) — not omitted | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 28. DPAT_API actions: provider has `"supports_request": True` and implements `doRequestImpl()` | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 29. DPAT_FIND actions: every option exists in `SearchOptions`, `getRecordTypeImpl()` returns `*hash<string, AbstractDataField>` | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 30. Scheme-based apps (with `"scheme"` in registerApp): actions use `"path"` and do NOT use `"cls"` — having both `scheme` and `cls` causes a runtime error | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 31. Single-key hash slices use trailing comma: `Fields{"key",}` (without trailing comma, `Fields{"key"}` returns the value, not a hash) | Pass | No single-key hash slice is used as a record; dynamic facet and choice access intentionally retrieves scalar entries. |
| 32. **Typed data type classes exist** for request and response types — inherit `HashDataType`, have `const Fields` hash, call `addQoreFields(Fields)` in constructor, export public constant at bottom (e.g., `public const MyDataType = new MyDataType();`) | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 33. Request/input types use `public` Fields (enables `ClassName::Fields` in action registration) | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 34. Response/output types use `private` Fields | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 35. Each field in data types has `display_name`, `type`, and `desc` (markdown-formatted) | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 36. Input fields have `example_value` where useful (string fields, endpoint URIs, SQL queries, etc.) | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 37. Fields with finite allowed values use `allowed_values` with `AllowedValueInfo` containing both `value` and `display_name` (Title Case, human-readable) — never bare values, never described only in text | Pass | String choices are normalized in their base space and filtered through every derived constraint. QoreDataField exposes AllowedValueInfo records with value/display_name, including scalar content and attributes; repeated field metadata is tested with core cbb8aceb2. |
| 38. Password/secret fields have `"sensitive": True` | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 39. `groups` uses `AppGroup` enum values from `qlib/DataProvider/AppGroup.qc` | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 40. App `logo` stored as separate file, loaded at module level in `Priv` namespace | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 41. App `desc` uses markdown: bullet list of capabilities, links to project website, business-language explanation of value | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 42. `display_name` is user-friendly ("Apache Avro" not "avro") | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 43. `short_desc` is plain text, under 80 chars, single sentence — no markdown | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 44. `desc` uses markdown: backticks for code/field refs (`` `field_name` ``, `` `True` ``, `` `pdf` ``), `\n\n` for paragraphs, `- ` bullet lists for enumerations, `**bold**` for caveats | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 45. Descriptions use plain business language relating to common challenges — not just technical "what" but "why" and "when to use" | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 46. No bare `True`/`False`/`NOTHING` — must be backtick-wrapped in `desc` | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 47. No bare field/option names in prose — must use backticks | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 48. Long descriptions (>500 chars) use bold section headers and bullet lists | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 49. **Factory registration in Qore repo**: every factory name registered in `qlib/DataProvider/DataProvider.qc` → `FactoryMap` (without this, module loads but doesn't appear in Qorus apps) | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 50. **`getRecordTypeImpl()` signature**: must be `private *hash<string, AbstractDataField> getRecordTypeImpl(*hash<auto> search_options)` — NOT returning `*AbstractDataProviderType` | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 51. **Dependency JARs committed** (for JNI modules): JAR files in `qlib/*/jar/` may be gitignored — use `git add -f` to ensure they're tracked, otherwise CI compilation fails | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 52. JAR install rules in CMakeLists.txt for all dependency JARs | N/A | No app/action, request/response record, connection factory, credentials or dependency JAR is introduced; scalar restriction metadata is not an application catalog. |
| 53. **No workarounds**: No TODOs, FIXMEs, stubs, or partially-implemented features | Pass | Rules implement XSD 1.0 string/length requirements without fixture-specific production branches or count clamping. Oracle disagreements have normative adjudication; all remaining P3 list/union/lexical requirements remain active and tracked. |
| 54. **Exception safety**: C++ uses `ReferenceHolder` for Qore allocations, `std::unique_ptr` for C++ allocations, `*xsink` checked after every fallible operation | Pass | Qore-managed values own metadata. Reconstruction validates facets/base and builds membership state before publication. Failed-schema-addition and malformed-provider tests preserve usable original state; cancellation is rethrown by sample-validation catches. |
| 55. **Thread safety**: All mutable shared state protected by `std::lock_guard<std::mutex>` or documented as immutable-after-construction | Pass | Provider facets and membership maps are private and read-only during acceptance. Optional variants construct new wrappers; schema configuration-before-sharing remains documented. |
| 56. **Type safety**: Strongly-typed `code<return(args)>` instead of untyped `code`; `static_cast` instead of C casts; typed hashdecls for results; enums where appropriate | Pass | XsdSizedFacetInfo and XsdFacetCount type facet metadata; provider/category signatures and downcast guards retain native value categories. Counts are compared before any bounded int conversion. |
| 57. **Performance**: No O(n²) where O(n) is possible; no unnecessary copies; coordinate descent uses incremental residuals not full matrix multiply | Pass | Counts use decimal-string comparison, not machine narrowing. Enumeration membership maps avoid repeated linear scans while field choices are validated. Generated strings/items/octets are bounded to 256; list resizing is bounded and checks nonempty seeds. |
| 58. **Error handling**: All inputs validated (dimensions, empty data, unfitted models); C++ I/O handles EAGAIN/EINTR if applicable | Pass | Checks cover malformed/inapplicable/widening/fixed/contradictory facets, Unicode counts, empty values/lists, nonscalar provider input, incompatible metadata categories, invalid serialized state and impossible examples. |
| 59. **Documentation**: Doxygen `@param`, `@return`, `@throw` on all public methods; `@par Example` with realistic business scenarios; `@note` for important caveats | Pass | New public metadata/provider/list-detection APIs have Doxygen documentation; scalar design, examples, release notes, README and normative adjudication describe semantics and generation bounds. Final Qdx/Doxygen validation passes without warnings. |
| 60. **QPP flags**: `[flags=CONSTANT]` on methods that never throw; `[flags=RET_VALUE_ONLY]` on methods that throw but have no side effects | N/A | No C++, QPP, native I/O or native loop changes. |
| 61. **Security**: No user-controlled format strings; no buffer overflows; bounds checking on array indices; no credentials in code | Pass | Diagnostic formats are literals. Facet counts do not directly size generated allocations; list seeds are checked before indexing. No credentials or external production I/O were added. |
| 62. **Correctness**: Algorithms verified against reference implementations; edge cases tested (empty data, single sample, all-zero features) | Pass | Authored matrices use pinned Xerces plus libxml2, exact strings/integer-list values/binary octets, expanded names, both real SOAP bindings/directions, reconstructed providers/contracts and generated messages. Strict coverage adds all sixteen string families and tests whitespace-aware value-change detection. |
